            We are pleased to announce that applications for the Risk and Resilience DAT/Artathon Workshop are now open. 
        </p>

        <p class="custom-p">
            DAT/Artathon is a free, three-week virtual workshop that brings together individuals working to visualize and tell stories from risk and resilience data. 
            The workshop will take place over six sessions from June 6 to June 23, 2022. 
            Sessions will take place from 5-7pm Mountain Time (4-6pm Pacific Time; 7-9pm Eastern Time). 

        </p>


        <p class="custom-p"> 
            Join our global, diverse, and supportive community of risk and resilience data visualizers!

            *While we encourage all to apply, in case of applicants with matching qualifications, preference will be
            given to those applicants who are within 5 years of their last degree.

        <h3 class="custom-header">What you'll do</h3>

        <p class="custom-p">
            You will be contributing to six virtual, two-hour sessions spanning over a period of three weeks. In the first
            three sessions, you will be sharing your skills with the cohort. Following this, you will then be working on
            your individual projects, whilst also providing and receiving feedback around you and your cohort's work.
        </p>


        <h3 class="custom-header">What you'll need</h3>

        <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 300;">
            <li>a <b>dataset</b> that you plan to work with during the DAT/Artathon</li>
            <li>a <b>skillset</b> to share with fellow DAT/Artists</li>
            <li>required <b>software and/or materials</b> for working on your project</li>
            <li>an open-minded attitude</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="custom-header">What’s different this year?</h3>
        <p class="custom-p">
            The previous DAT/Artathon Workshops have been scheduled for late July and early August. This year, we are moving the dates to the month of June. The DAT/Artathon will still take place over 6 sessions, but they will now span a duration of 3 weeks (previously 4 weeks). We hope this can better meet availability, as we know everyone is busy. 
        </p>

        <p class="custom-p">
            Can't make this time slot (4-6PM Pacific time, 5-7PM Mountain Time)? 
            We alternate between US mornings and evenings every other year so that we can accommodate time zones across the globe. 
            Please check back next year if this time is outside of your normal <b>waking</b> hours! We appreciate our Fellows' willingness to participate outside of normal <b>working</b> hours in order to build this global community!

                    <p class="custom-p">
                        When I read about DATArtathon, I was completely sold on the idea of interacting with people who are passionate about risk, disasters, and data visualization. 
                        Let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations. During the DATArtathon, I learned several strategies to make data more inclusive and informative. At the same time, it was gratifying to know that this is more than a workshop. 
                        I still keep in touch with multiple people from the team, and we also created a book club to start discussions about the intersection of disaster policy, data visualization, and science writing. 
                        I am excited to see this community grow so people can better understand all the pressing needs of this world with the power of data.</p>

                        of people, experiences, and possibilities in the data world. I loved the peer-taught sessions,
