Dr. Yolanda Lin develops computational tools and methods in disaster risk analysis for identifying, analyzing, and communicating extreme events. She is interested in low-probability, high-impact, data-sparse events at the intersection of natural hazards, the built environment, and society. She focuses on the nonlinear impacts in disasters that can have significant implications for understanding past, current, and future risk at the city and regional scales. Her work contributes towards disaster preparedness and mitigation. She is an assistant professor at the University of New Mexico in the department of Geography and Environmental Studies.
