            three sessions, you will be sharing your skills with the cohort. Following this, you will then be working on
            your individual projects, whilst also providing and receiving feedback around you and your cohort's work.

                    <p class="custom-p">
                        When I read about DATArtathon, I was completely sold on the idea of interacting with people who are passionate about risk, disasters, and data visualization. 
                        Let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations. During the DATArtathon, I learned several strategies to make data more inclusive and informative. At the same time, it was gratifying to know that this is more than a workshop. 
                        I still keep in touch with multiple people from the team, and we also created a book club to start discussions about the intersection of disaster policy, data visualization, and science writing. 
                        I am excited to see this community grow so people can better understand all the pressing needs of this world with the power of data.</p>

                        encouraged me to try things I might not have tried on my own and introduced me to a wide range
                        of people, experiences, and possibilities in the data world. I loved the peer-taught sessions,
